	/* EffectObject inheritance rules
	 * If an effect has been assigned, it will use that effect regardless of its parent's effect.
	 * If a technique has been assigned, it will be set on the effect before drawing.
	 * If no technique has been assigned, the effect will be used as-is, meaning that the parent's will be inherited.
	 * If no effect has been assigned, the parent's will be used. It is stored in a static variable.
	 * If no effect has been assigned, the parent's FXConstants will be used along with the child's.
	 * If an effect has been assigned, parent FXConstants will not be used. The constant list will be cleared.
	 * Inheriting parent FXConstants means inheriting its parent's and so forth, so long as any were inherited.
