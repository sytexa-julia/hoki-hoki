| MAP FORMAT |
+------------+

Maps are stored as text files. The files are meant to be broken down line-by-line by a map reader (ie. split on '\n'). There are three main types of
lines:

1. Directives

These lines begin with a # sign, followed by some string identifying the type of information being given, then a space and a value:

#DECL_NAME VALUE

There are two in use: #NODECOUNT specifies the number of nodes in the map, and #POLYCOUNT specifies the number of triangles. In the future, author, date,
and theme fields will be added.

2. Modes

These lines begin with a > sign, followed by a string identifying the mode to set:

>MODE

They tell the map reader how to interpret the data in subsequent lines. The modes are NODES, TRIANGLES, LINES, and PADS. They must always appear in the 
file in that order.

3. Values

Values are a sequence of comma-delimited numbers:

NUMBER,NUMBER,...

Their meaning depends on whatever the last mode line was. The formats for different modes are listed below:

NODES:		X,Y
TRIANGLES:	NODE0,NODE1,NODE2
LINES:		NODE0,NODE1
PADS:		X,Y,TYPE

For lines and triangles, the numbers listed are the indices of nodes in the NODES section.

For pads, the TYPE values are: 0 - Start, 1 - End, 2 - Heal

| USERFILE FORMAT |
+-----------------+

Recorded information about individual users is recorded in a text file. In order to prevent users from tampering with this, the file might be encrypted,
but that is up to the program's implementation.

There are three types of lines:

1. Usernames

These begin with a # symbol, followed by the player's name, and indicate that the following lines apply to that player:

#PLAYERNAME

2.Scores

The file contains one score per line. The facts are in the format

LEVEL:BEST_TIME:PERFECT

Where LEVEL is some unique function of the map file that the time applies to (for example, an MD5 hash), BEST_TIME is the number of milliseconds that the
user took to complete the level on his or her best attempt, and PERFECT is a 0 or 1 indicating whether the player got through the level without hitting
anything (not necessarily on the same run as the best time was achieved). The absence of a level from the file implies that the user did not complete it.

3. Options

These begin with a > symbol. They are options that only affect an individual player (unlike the ones in the config file). They are in the following format:

>OPTIONNAME:VALUE

The options in use are:

EASY, for easy mode, where the value 1 means use easy and 0 means use normal.

+------------------+
| SCOREFILE FORMAT |
+------------------+

The top scores for each level (common between all users) are recorded in a text file. In order to prevent users from tampering with this, the file might
be encrypted, but that is up to the program's implementation.

The file is meant to be read line-by-line. There are two types of lines:

1. Levels

These begin with a > symbol, followed by some unique funtion of the level that the following scores apply to (for example, an MD5 hash):

>LEVEL

2. Scores

These are in the format:

PLAYER_NAME:TIME

Where TIME is the number of milliseconds it took the player to complete the level. These should be sorted by ascending time.
