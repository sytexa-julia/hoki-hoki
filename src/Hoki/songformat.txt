format for a song file:

-----------------------------

number of separate sound files
soundfile 1
soundfile 2
...
soundfile n
sound1 numberloops
sound2 numberloops
...
soundn numberloops

-----------------------------

sounds are indexed by the order they're listed in the file, so if you want to
play the second sample twice and then the first sample three times you'd write

1 2
0 3

the program assumes there's no blank lines.
